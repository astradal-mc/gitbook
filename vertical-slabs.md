# Vertical Slabs

## How does it work?

1. **Crafting the Tool:** Craft the Vertical Slabs Converter tool by placing a book above a stick on a crafting grid.

1. **Converting slabs:** Right-click on any slab of your choice to seamlessly convert it into a vertical slab.
2. **Rotation slabs:** For precise customization, perform additional right-clicks to change the rotation of the vertical slab according to your design preferences.
3. **Removing slabs:** Left-click on a vertical slab to remove it.

### Important Notes:

* Vertical slabs have the hitbox of a full-sized block.
* You must hold the Vertical Slabs Converter item in your main hand to convert, edit, and remove vertical slabs.
* You cannot build against the verticle slabs.
* Rotation is clockwise.
