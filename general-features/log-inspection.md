# Log Inspection

## Commands  <a href="#command-details" id="command-details"></a>

`/co inspect` or `/co i`  - Enable the inspector. Type the command again to disable it.

Many actions on the server are logged for moderation purposes. You can inspect some of these logs yourself by entering inspector mode, and left and right clicking on blocks and containers.

* Left clicking a block will tell you the logs for that specific block.
* Right clicking a block will tell you the logs for the block adjacent to it, on the face clicked.&#x20;

> If you right click the floor you'll get the logs for the block above the floor.

* Right clicking a container (chest, barrel, furnace) will give you logs for the addition and removal of items from the container.
