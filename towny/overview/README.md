# Overview

### Description

Towny is a manager for a Resident-Town-Nation hierarchy, as well as a block permission manager for a chunk-based protection system.\
Each town has a mayor, while a nation has a king. They both have their own assistants to help run their respective people. Players can also purchase land from the town, as well as an optional daily tax set by the mayor. The player can allow his friends from out of town to build on his land when even his very own town's people can't build if he so wishes.

### Features

**Allows players to own and manage land based on a pre-set grid layout.**

* Players join towns and purchase plots of land.
* Players decide who can build, destroy, use "switchs" and use items on every plot they control.
* Towns can join together into nations, further structuring a server into teams.
* Towns grant protection from monsters, fire, explosions and griefing.

**Teleporting/Warping and Spawning**

* Players can spawn to their town upon death.
* Players can spawn to their town or a town that is within their nation/allied with their nation.
* Use of beds can be limited to personally-owned land and players can spawn there.
