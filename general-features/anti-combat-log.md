# Anti-Combat-Log

## Overview

When you enter combat you and the other player are "combat tagged."

Combat tags last **15 seconds**, and <mark style="color:red;">if you log out while combat tagged you instantly die</mark> and your grave drops.

You can see how much time is left on your combat tag with the timer on the scoreboard on the right side of your screen.
