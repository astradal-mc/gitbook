# Cultures

## Introduction

* TownyCultures is an add-on for Towny, which enables "cultures"
* Players that share a culture have their own "chat" channel.
* Towns choose what culture they want to be a part of.

## Description

* Each town has a 'culture' e.g. "Greek", "Celtic", "Roman", "Azurian" etc.
* Each town culture is displayed on the Town screen.
* Town residents can communicate with all other town residents of the same culture (regardless of nation),\
  using the Culture Channel: `/cc <message>`.
* Town culture is fluid and dynamic. There is no central administrator for each culture.\
  A new culture can be created by a mayor, using: `/town set culture <culture>`.\
  The same command can be used to join an existing culture.
* Nations do not create or specify culture in this way.\
  Instead their culture is the sum of whichever cultures their component towns identify with,\
  and/or whichever culture(s) they might claim to be affiliated with.
* Culture is important in war systems where town transfer-after-invasion is possible,\
  because although a town might be transferred to an enemy nation,\
  the residents can continue communicating with their friends in the same culture,\
  using the Culture Channel: `/cc <message>`.

## Commands
