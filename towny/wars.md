# Wars

Wars are begun by an admin using `/ta war {wartype} ...` or via town-purchased Declaration of War books.\
\
Declarations of War are purchased via Tokens using `/town redeem {wartype}`.\
\
Tokens are earned by every non-neutral town each Towny newday. If a town is part of a nation that nation must not be neutral either. Towns with an active war will also not receive war tokens.

## War types

* **Riot** - One town fighting amongst itself. Players side with the city or the rioters via team selection.
* **Town vs Town** - Two towns fight against each other.
* **Civil War** - One nation fighting amongst itself. Towns side with the capital or the rebels via team selection.
* **Independence War** - A war in which a conquered Town fights its own nation for freedom. The town which initiates the war will trigger a team-selection for the other non-capital towns. Towns which side with the rebels will also leave their nation if the rebels win. If the rebels lose all of the rebel towns become conquered.
* **Nation vs Town** - One nation makes war on a town, attempting to conquer it. If the targeted town is part of a nation, that nation's towns will also join the war to defend the target town.
* **Nation vs Nation** - Two nations fight against each other.
* **Alliance vs Alliance** - Two nations fight against each other, with both nations' allies able to join the fight.
* **World War** - All nations with enemies will be thrown into war. Similar to the old EventWar.
